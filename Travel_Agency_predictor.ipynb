This project aims to build a machine learning model for predicting travel agency outcomes using various classification techniques. The dataset is preprocessed, followed by exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and performance evaluation. The following machine learning models were implemented:

1.Logistic Regression

2.K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

3.Neural Networks (NN)

**Key Features**

**Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, categorical feature encoding, and scaling of numerical features.

**Modeling:** Logistic Regression, KNN, and Neural Networks for predicting the outcomes.

**Evaluation Metrics:** Includes ROC curve, AUC, Precision, Recall, Accuracy, and K-Fold Cross-Validation.

**Visualization:** Visualizations for model performance (Confusion Matrix, ROC curve) and EDA (Box Plots, Distribution Analysis).

**Tools & Libraries**

1.scikit-learn: For model training, evaluation, and preprocessing.

2.TensorFlow (Keras): For building neural networks.

3.Matplotlib / Seaborn: For visualizations.
